[Intro]
G - D - Em - C

[Verse 1]
G          D
Well you dawned on me and you danced on me
Em          C
Like a lady to a Tango, you danced on me
G          D
And I fell into your open arms
Em          C
I don't know how it happened, but I don't mind

[Chorus]
G    D
I'm yours
Em    C
I'm yours

[Verse 2]
G                   D
Open up your mind and see like me,
Em                   C
Open up your plans and damn you're free.
G                   D
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love.
Em                   C
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family.

[Chorus]
G                                   D
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, love, loved, love, loved,
Em                                   C
So I won't hesitate no more, no more, it cannot wait, I'm sure.
G                   D
There's no need to complicate, our time is short,
Em                   C
This is our fate, I'm yours.

[Bridge]
G                   D
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
Em                   C
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
G                   D
But my breath fogged up the glass
Em                   C
And so I drew a new face and I laughed.

[Chorus]
G    D
I'm yours
Em    C
I'm yours

[Outro]
G - D - Em - C
G - D - Em - C
